Hello!

I guess this is kind of like the first blog post on my new platform. The content of this post will be the instructions that I followed in order to build this website. This is both for me and for you as I highlight what I think will be important in developing your website with a similar platform. This is my process documentation.

Let's get started! I will also supplement with youtube videos that I followed.

So first off go [create your website repository][github-setup] on [Github][github]. If you do not have a Github, then make one. Name your repository "*Username*.github.io" where *Username* is your Github username. Next go download [Github Desktop][github-desktop], and install it. Copy your website repository to your machine. If you want a different webaddress than "*Username*.github.io", then go to godaddy or freenom or google domains and get whatever web address tickles your funnybone. I personally got mine at godaddy because I found a promotional for like $1 for a year of mateoatwi.com. I had to edit the records a little bit as shown in the image bellow, and I had to add a CNAME file with the web address name to my repo.
