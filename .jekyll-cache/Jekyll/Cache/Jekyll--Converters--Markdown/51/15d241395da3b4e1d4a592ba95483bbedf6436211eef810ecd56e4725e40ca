At NASA in the Spring of 2019, I was tasked with creating <a href="/work&amp;education/#advanced-exercise-intern-at-nasa-johnson-space-center-spring-2019">video games to be tested at NEEMO 23</a>. I created two games. The first game used the position telemetry from the MED-2 to map to a character position in the game. The second game received heart rate data from MoBI and used that to control the characterâ€™s position vertically. I then went on to run operations at NEEMO 23 with a crew including an astronaut, an astronaut candidate, and two scientists.</p>
