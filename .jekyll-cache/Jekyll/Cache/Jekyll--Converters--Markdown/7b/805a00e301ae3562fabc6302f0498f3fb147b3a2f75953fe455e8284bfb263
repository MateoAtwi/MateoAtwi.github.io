This is one of my favorite projects. My friend Chris and I jointly developed an electric longboard using a maker grant at the Georgia Tech Invention Studio where we are both prototyping instructors. This longboard had severval innovative design features. Our first design had a lot of flaws, but I attribute this to the extent that we tried to innovate. Our innovations include batteries imbeded into the deck of the longboard and a fiberglass bottom. Additionally, we tried to build most things in house with the motor mounts and the deck.</p>
