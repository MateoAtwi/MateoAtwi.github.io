<p><br />
So, I decided to get into 3D printing seriously today. I purchased the <strong>Original Prusa i3 MK3S kit</strong>. Really excited to print rocket parts and other things.</p>

<p><br />
Hereâ€™s some tips I found on a forum for smoothing out the 3D print:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tamiya putty, to smooth very rough areas</li>
  <li>gunze/mr.hobby mr.surfacer, itâ€™s basically liquid putty I used for spot corrections</li>
  <li>dupli-color filler primer, this is applied in layers between each sanding session</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
I would like to note that I have significant experience 3D printing things with the Invention Studio at Georgia Tech; however, besides basic troubleshooting, I have very little experience working on the actual machines.</p>
