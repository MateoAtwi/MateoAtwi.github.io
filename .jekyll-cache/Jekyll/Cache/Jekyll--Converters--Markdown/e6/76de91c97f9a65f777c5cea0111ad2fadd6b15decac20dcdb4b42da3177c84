This summer at Stuller, we wanted to see the flow of traffic through our hallways in order to understand the times where there might be higher traffic. I was tasked with coming up with a way to count the heads coming through the hallway. I decided to do so using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a web cam. My $100 solution gave us a reasonable estimate for the traffic through our hallways during the day.</p>
