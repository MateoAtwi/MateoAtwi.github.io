At <a href="/work&amp;education/#advanced-exercise-intern-at-nasa-johnson-space-center-spring-2018">NASA in the Spring of 2018</a>, I was tasked with designing a rig that would transform the MED-2 into a rowing machine on earth. Currently, the MED-2 can we be used in zero-g to row, but we would like to be able to test that here on the ground. This projet was really fun, and even though I started it pretty late into the semester the interns of the next few semesters built it.</p>
