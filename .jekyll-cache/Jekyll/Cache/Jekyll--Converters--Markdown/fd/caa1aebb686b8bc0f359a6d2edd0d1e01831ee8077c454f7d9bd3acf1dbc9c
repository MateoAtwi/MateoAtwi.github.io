Fall of 2019 I designed a test rig to mount a hall effect sensor near an electric motor with toothed wheel attached to the output shaft. The goal was to find ways to measure RPM on a spinning system. I created this both <a href="/dataAquisition/">for GTOR</a> and for a mechanical engineering class called Experimental Methods. It was a lot of fun to CAD then create a fully functioning rig with a powerful electrical motor.</p>
