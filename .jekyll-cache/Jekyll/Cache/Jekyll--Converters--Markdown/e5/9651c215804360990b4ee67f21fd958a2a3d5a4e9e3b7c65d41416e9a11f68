Junior year of my time at Georgia Tech in 2017, I took an infamous class called ME 2110 (Creative Decisions and Design). This class is infamous because it culminates in a competition between the teams of 3 or 4. Each team builds and programs a mechatronics robot to compete in an arena with 3 other teams. There are several different ways to gain or lose points, and the objective is to get the highest score. I highlight this as one of my projects because it was formative for my engineering experience. My team placed in the top 20 of seventy teams. This class was one of funnest and toughest classes Iâ€™ve taken.</p>
