This was one of my projects at <a href="/work&amp;education/">NASA during the spring of 2019</a>. My branch, ER3, received new exercise hardware from a company called IHMC. ER3 is setting up a database of exercise equipment as it comes through to be able to quickly compare and contrast hardware to each other. I created a test plan to catalogue new devices.</p>
