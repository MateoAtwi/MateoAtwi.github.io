In the Fall of 2019, I joined the Georgia Tech Off Road (GTOR) club to help as a Data Aquisition Engineer. GTOR develops and builds a new off road car every year to compete with. The data aquisition team started this semester. There was a little bit of work done prior, but not much. It was a lot of fun to research the best ways to gather data and different sensors to use. It also made me realize that it is very tricky to get good sensor data.</p>
