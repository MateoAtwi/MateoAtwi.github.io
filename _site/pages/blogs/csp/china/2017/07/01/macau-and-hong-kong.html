<meta name="description" content="Last weekend I visited Macau and Hong Kong. Friday we went to the electronics market in the morning to buy some resistors and other electronics components for my circuits class. After that we took the metro to the ferry to Zuhai. In Zuhai we left our stuff at the Airbnb and went to Macau. Macau is pretty great in my opinion. It is a Portuguese colony, so all the signs have Chinese and Portuguese. The casinos are so grandiose. We went inside of the Venetian. It has its own river inside of it and so many shops. You could lose track of time because it feels like daytime perpetually. Saturday we took another ferry to Hong Kong. We explored Hong Kong and got to see Chunking Mansion, a market featured in many films. We explored other places and finally went to Victoria’s peak. It was a great view of Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a really cool city and I did not get to spend much time there, but it is super easy for Americans to get into. The city seems well organized but also very crowded. The next morning Tiago and I went to church at Saint Andrews Anglican church. I enjoyed the service very much. It was like Peter’s Church. And then probably the favorite part of my weekend, Monkey Hill! Tiago and I went for a hike on Monkey Hill and got to see the Monkeys! We also so a great view of the city from our hike. After that we went home to Shenzhen, it was a very chill weekend. Travel between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is so easy because their metro lines connect." />
