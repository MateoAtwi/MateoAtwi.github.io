First I created a python script that reads a csv file and creates the headers and front matter for posts. That was fun.

Now I want to write a scraper for my images

First I had to get pip

`sudo apt install python-pip`

Then I had to install lxml and requests

```
pip install lxml
pip install requests

```

pip install --user pyperclip
