At NASA in the Spring of 2019, I was tasked with creating &lt;a href=&quot;/work&amp;amp;education/#advanced-exercise-intern-at-nasa-johnson-space-center-spring-2019&quot;&gt;video games to be tested at NEEMO 23&lt;/a&gt;. I created two games. The first game used the position telemetry from the MED-2 to map to a character position in the game. The second game received heart rate data from MoBI and used that to control the character’s position vertically.&lt;/p&gt;

This was one of my projects at &lt;a href=&quot;/work&amp;amp;education/&quot;&gt;NASA during the spring of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. My branch, ER3, received new exercise hardware from a company called IHMC. ER3 is setting up a database of exercise equipment as it comes through to be able to quickly compare and contrast hardware to each other. I created a test plan to catalogue new devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Together with another intern, we considered software, electrical, and mechanical design to determine what parameters are worth cataloging about a device. We ended up focusing mainly on the mechanical side of the device looking at the available exercises and the operational volume. We saw the potential for more tests to be conducted; however, the tradeoff is time.&lt;/p&gt;

This was a challening task because I had to think about ways to test a device and what parameters can be recorded for comparison between exercise hardware. Test plans are very valuable for selecting from a growing list of available devices. Having clear objectives for a test plan are imperative; otherwise, the test plan create will find themselves with too many aspects to test.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mateo Atwi</name></author><summary type="html">This was one of my projects at NASA during the spring of 2019.

Fall of 2019 I designed a test rig to mount a hall effect sensor near an electric motor with toothed wheel attached to the output shaft. The goal was to find ways to measure RPM on a spinning system. I created this both &lt;a href=&quot;/dataAquisition/&quot;&gt;for GTOR&lt;/a&gt; and for a mechanical engineering class called Experimental Methods. It was a lot of fun to CAD then create a fully functioning rig with a powerful electrical motor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/mqQWzByrxmz9o6Tm6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Cbmrc8F1Ao1XPzyBhq5GreNGpWejB78jsHWB_zRzkzs_eyqjl3wU69cod3c4ZeSVoUasuNCfsDLRcX3MtMwqfKwz7WE6BtXwYxWM3ieBInu1JsLQQd5jzCYO9BiShV_mONXTE8oxmrU=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is related to &lt;a href=&quot;/dataAquisition/&quot;&gt;my work at GTOR&lt;/a&gt; on the Data Aquisition Team. We wanted to figure out the best ways to measure rotational speed at different points on the transmission and engine our car. The team had little experience measuring rotational speed, so this project was really an opportunity to learn as much as I could about different systems for measuring rotational speed. I ended up using a hall effect sensor like the kind that are used in car wheels because we had one. Additionally, I was able to build the rig to use in my Experimental Methods Lab. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/14DqmXZMwtFzi6SnHA16e7BKpqUF4us2y/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Here is the executive summary that me and my lab partners wrote.&lt;/a&gt; The whole point of the class is to learn how to use sensors to measure things and how to analize the data from measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the lab expirement I decided to study how reliable the hall effect sensor is for measuring rotational speed. Additionally, I studied the Nyquist frequency or how the sampling rate effects the measurements. Finally, I studied how differnet tooth shapes and the number of teeth on a wheel effect the reading of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZE4yfPLpeSvWHPCP7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9cjFo7BQlDTdwvlu_2Pb5bDdONrA3KL6oafT46p7Y14uuCLn_MidT6dsFI2omomRzCNYFy8ng9Cgg53_xxnB5iLqUKahEqDj3iTF0eHGfHpL8f5jd0SRAzNPFIpx17H95TyRf-9TOw8=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I designed the test rig from scratch. I knew that I needed the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A ferrous toothed wheel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some way to spin a ferrous toothed wheel wheel very fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some way to hold a sensor very close the the spinning toothed wheel.
Those were the goals that I set out with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I found quarter inch steel to water jet toothed wheels out of. I machined 4 different kinds of wheels. I made one per the spec sheet of the guide. I made another one with fewer teeth. I made a zigzag toothed one, and I made a convoluted gear shaped one. That process was pretty straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/cE37b2jMtzmtvzuAA&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wVPI8WrQJEhcOCKsEm28XDj8qWYXX-2yqTbhbgpL_gPIWSopDSmvfPkavWMCN1lIk0IOd25-dEUfGqs3lD2Ii2vtvJBp_U_RGUaE-BUFHhXlf_fbimZ2hc5RlQgdvQJ3_H3RO-m2o4c=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/D4UrGQjVUwXzJbWq5&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PtX9GSgCeNesfQ3yUrusYPld8BJV_t6HHJK2xdQpjnW8G_jUqjFs3AjoeGm-Foctbglanf8ZbJmAN-zvdI6-yhnZ572ZLfccXBJ-dO-w1P8joh0KxKdQmwvxBhkJL0QO_3aii3zV028=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I decided to use my electric longboard motor to spin the wheels because I already had it. All I had to do was make sure that the holes in the toothed wheels were big enough. There was already a collet system for clamping the wheels in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/kbKgpmpia8nPwvNb9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g_YmI0p93kcR6Seb3kXy5vA8eXL90MMypQu5u2FkfP6el8AM-bKwwQvaiuUrleLb4GvXVur428WAoemDt_i7PrAvqa5Hus7MQi6UibzPkdM8cmBxpq1ZiG8vt1naVnbwgikrCVCHeVA=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, I machined a scrap peice of aluminium to mount my parts to and bent a small mounting bracket for the hall effect sensor. I made strips in the mounting peice so that I could finely adjust the location of the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lab&quot;&gt;Lab&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The lab went very well. I was able to adapt code from a vibrations lab to be used with the hall effect sensor. The code would run an FFT on the measurements of the hall effect sensor. I had the power supply hooked up to the speed controller for the motor. There was a very linear correlation between the speed of the wheel and the voltage supplied. We measured the first few data points with a handheld laser tachiometer to verify the linear realtionship of voltage to max RPMs. We ran the lab fairly smoothly. We even showed the Nyquist frequency!&lt;/p&gt;

The data aquisition team started this semester. There was a little bit of work done prior, but not much. It was a lot of fun to research the best ways to gather data and different sensors to use. It also made me realize that it is very tricky to get good sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Data collection (as I’ve discovered) is a very tricky business. Here’s my list of things you need to do to get meaningful results from data collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good sensors with adequate resolution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mounting the sensors to your system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wiring the sensors to a computer or a small portable computer for a moving system like ours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Program the computer to collect data fast enough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reliably store data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analyize the data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make changes and adjustments based off of the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here’s a parallel project that I did to work with a &lt;a href=&quot;/testRig/&quot;&gt;hall effect sensor as research&lt;/a&gt; for the group and as part of a class project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development-work&quot;&gt;Development Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Before the Fall of 2019, GTOR had a few students working on measuring RPMs and setting up data aquisition systems. Their work was several years old by the time I got around to joining. The first thing we had to do was decide what kind of data we wanted to gather. We opted to get IMUs and place them on the suspension. Additionally, we had some linear potentiometers that we could mount to the shocks on the car. We used a MyRio to collect data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/r7tfavzBz8yW75HL8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6IQ0gmRmLJUxVfN0y9P3Pbz0hMecVxR9uZVhIN5UHd1NY9_EDxnWABfMWWL5SOc4TrMRERXOgNvmB3Be2aVtK1IaIKrjYVvIM6cSL_hVndYNMxcEB-i8ScJ9Cwblp-b_VLSyC7uGynU=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We mounted our parts and coded the program. I learned how to use I2C on the accelerometers with labview. That was a cool experience to learn how to send values to the registers. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a good grasp of how to increase the data collection rate, so the accelerometers did not gather useful data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Data collection with sensors is very tricky. I would reccomend really understand what are the best computers to use for this process. Additionally, I think that it would be nice to consult industry experience to see how they measure things. I want to learn better how to do data measurement with python and C as well as FPGA stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

My &lt;a href=&quot;/work&amp;amp;education/#advanced-exercise-intern-at-nasa-johnson-space-center-spring-2018&quot;&gt;frist semester at NASA&lt;/a&gt; I worked as the recovery subsystem lead on the intern rocket. My team designed and fabricated our own parachute for a very cheap price. It worked perfectly when we launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was the first semester that the rocketry club at JSC was a formal intern committee. There was no handover documents. There was no prior experience. Only a few members on the team had ever built a model rocket from scratch. So we dived right into it. I volunteered to be the recovery subsystem lead. I was in charge of delivering a system for returning the rocket. I worked closely with Peata Ameperosa. She is really good at building parachutes, and she is a lot of fun to work with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are my design requirements that I developed with the other people in my team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Descent rate between 12 and 18 feet per second&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handmade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After doing my research, I decided to make my own parachute. It would be more fun to make my own. Once I had a general idea of the size and weight of the rocket, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://descentratecalculator.onlinetesting.net/&quot;&gt;a website to calculate the radius required&lt;/a&gt; for a descent rate of around 15 feet per second. Because it was easier to cut, I decided to make a hexagonal parachute. Additionally, that made it very simple to find points for mounting the shroud lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another intern and I went to Wallmart and purchased a purple tablecloth. We used an exacto knife to cut it into a hexagon. Next, we reinforced the corners with duct tape first then we clamped metal grommits onto the duct tape patches. The duct tape served to destribute the load from the shroud lines that would be tied to the metal grommits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/YSyuC4kXLYErJCLF8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fJb8vjnFs2VH8G7d_yI0tYkWXZipUQfkyKkbe9WYZJmypcZt8rwwkZQdfkYYwjn-lFtdS6gMHl_2ocCWVojvrPfsO4Jy7mzmVYg4O9FDiAXj0OC5286ATtHEgCLs6HMeZ4dCBoWnMuE=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We found that the shroud lines should be about as wide as the diameter of the parachute. After tying the shroud lines, I tied an elastic band to the shroud lines. This band serves as the shock cable. I glued the other end of the elastic shock cable to the inside of the body after folding it around a peice of cardboard to help distribute the load on the interior surface of the rocket body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s some more testing:&lt;/p&gt;

This was a great project. We got to see our product from start to finish. The biggest flaw in our system was that we didn’t have a good way to attach to the 3D printed nosecone. I highly reccomend having a strong tab on your nosecone to tie your shock cable to. It is worth it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mateo Atwi</name></author><summary type="html">My frist semester at NASA I worked as the recovery subsystem lead on the intern rocket.

At &lt;a href=&quot;/work&amp;amp;education/#advanced-exercise-intern-at-nasa-johnson-space-center-spring-2018&quot;&gt;NASA in the Spring of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, I was tasked with designing a rig that would transform the MED-2 into a rowing machine on earth. Currently, the MED-2 can we be used in zero-g to row, but we would like to be able to test that here on the ground. This projet was really fun, and even though I started it pretty late into the semester the interns of the next few semesters built it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/qnVSvqFCgn3gUCPB9&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DLuD1HV43sSFl_t4C-M474_4zG0JJGX4Zo5yyvE4n5dsDMHqie6oUndwhhBrzQVAKZue_yJU2nRwjFGRmBcSFlYmFBaL_KbwdangHN1DmKjfey61hMF0trnxrB22jSChh6TGKTEwYl0=w2400&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 49%; position: relative;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The MED-2 is a very powerful device because it allows you to get position data, and you can change the load on the user in the software. We wanted to create a rowing setup to be able to row on Earth because astronauts could already row in space. In order to row with the MED-2, we had to design a rig that would route the cable towards the user sitting on a Concept-2 row rail. Additionally, we had to place foot plates and a mounting point for the rowing rail. Another thing we were trying to do was create the smallest footprint possible with the system so that we could bring it to the underwater habitat for NEEMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Without much time, I quickly modeled up a system where one side is a mounting system for a pully and the other side is the foot plates and rail resting point. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RpGk-ihM5Epa5Kl36md8Cz1O3REoavNq/view&quot;&gt;Basic drawings can be found here.&lt;/a&gt; It was really fun just to figure out how to work with the 80-20 extruded aluminium because there are limitations to how it can be assembled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After getting to see footage of people testing the device, I realized a huge design mistake that I didn’t think of earlier. The whole device and platform lurches upward when a user tried to row on it. This is because the device and platform is not secured in a way that prevents pivoting around the track that the user sits on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mateo Atwi</name></author><summary type="html">At NASA in the Spring of 2018, I was tasked with designing a rig that would transform the MED-2 into a rowing machine on earth.
