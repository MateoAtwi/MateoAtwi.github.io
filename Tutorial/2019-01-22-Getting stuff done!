Getting stuff done!
1/22/19

Use Liquid to change features
the format is the following:
{{ "TEXT" | downcase}}



.md files are mark down files

created a _layout folder with a layout inside of it
layouts are templates

This is how you view a theme's location
bundle show minima
the README.md file has some interesting information


created the _includes file which allows you to create code snippets that are included everywhere!
For example, a navigation bar will use an include to be included everywhere!


YAML
very useful for making iterative things for better site navigation and other data

assets folder and management

aparently sass is a great css style management thingy
/*
empty front matter tells Jekyll to process
front matter is indicated by "---"
@import "main"; tells Sass to look for main.scss in the default _sass/ directory
*/

continue where you left off in assets

It will take some work to develop a good looking website, but if you take the time to do it then you will learn a lot and it will look pretty nice.
