Hello and welcome back.

This is going to be my learning blog for today. I'm starting off by looking into all that can be done with liquid!

https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/operators/

So basically, liquid will allow us to do a lot. It allows us to practically code stuff in our website. It's so cool:)

Now I'm going to try to highlight some code. I guess I will do it in my blog tutorial or something.
Here is a list of codes that you can highlight. This is pretty cool!

So I understand how to highlight the code, but I don't understand how to give it color and such... Let's do it!

{% highlight ruby %}
#OR this following line will add line numbers!
{% highlight ruby linenos%}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I got it to work.
I used this article:
https://mycyberuniverse.com/syntax-highlighting-jekyll.html

Now I plan on reviewing the minima files to understand the structure that they use.

So just to catch you up with some of the stuff that I did today.

in the _config.yml file I added highlighter: rouge to use rouge to highlight code.

In main.scss, I added an import for the stylesheet for monokai.

So now I want to format the website, and I want to do it the right way. I'm going to follow the minima format.

So first I'm going to edit my main.scss
I copied over some default values for things so far. It seems pretty straight forward.

We should edit all the defaul values as soon as stuff starts showing up:)




This is something to look into later:
