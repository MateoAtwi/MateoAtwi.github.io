My name is Mateo Atwi. I was born in New Iberia, Louisiana in 1999. I was homeschooled until 6th grade, and after that I went to school at the Episcopal School of Acadiana. I currently attend the Georgia Institute of Technology where I study Mechanical Engineering.

I enjoy programming, engineering, learning, music, and just about anything that is interesting and requires doing! My list of skills and hobbies includes wood working, playing piano, picking blueberries, cooking, singing, dancing, longboarding, drawing, painting, and now building websites!
