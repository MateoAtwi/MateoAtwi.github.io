# Getting Into 3D Printing
*5/30/19*

\\
So, I decided to get into 3D printing seriously today. I purchased the **Original Prusa i3 MK3S kit**. Really excited to print rocket parts and other things.

\\
Here's some tips I found on a forum for smoothing out the 3D print:
- tamiya putty, to smooth very rough areas
- gunze/mr.hobby mr.surfacer, it's basically liquid putty I used for spot corrections
- dupli-color filler primer, this is applied in layers between each sanding session

\\
I would like to note that I have significant experience 3D printing things with the Invention Studio at Georgia Tech; however, besides basic troubleshooting, I have very little experience working on the actual machines.
