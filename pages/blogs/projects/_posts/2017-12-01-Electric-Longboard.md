summary: This is one of my favorite projects. My friend Chris and I jointly developed an electric longboard using a maker grant at the Georgia Tech Invention Studio where we are both prototyping instructors. This longboard had severval innovative design features. Our first design had a lot of flaws, but I attribute this to the extent that we tried to innovate. Our innovations include batteries imbeded into the deck of the longboard and a fiberglass bottom. Additionally, we tried to build most things in house with the motor mounts and the deck.

### Background

\\
Sometime my second year at Georgia Tech, me and my friend Chris Louie decided to build an electric longboard and make Georgia Tech pay for it. See, we both work as Prototyping Instructors(PIs) for the Invention Studio at Georgia Tech. PIs are not paid; however, they have perks like 24 hour access to the studio and funding for projects. So we decided to jointly work on some projects. It was really fun!

\\
Since we had access to the studio, we decided to make as much as we could. Additionally, we didn't just want to follow a tutorial, so we decided to add features that you don't see in most boards. This made the project tougher for us especially since we had a lot of work to do with our classes.

### Our Design

\\
We designed a pretty standard longboard. The biggest difference was that we wanted to embed as much of the electronics and battery stuff into the deck itself. This challenge proved harder than we initial thought it would be. Other than that we designed a pretty standard board. We machined custom motor mounting equipment to use.
