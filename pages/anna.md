Sorry for the delay between posts. Things have been so busy here. Really wish I could be with you in Europe or that you could be here in Florida. Enjoy this photo of me in an oldfashioned diving helmet.

# Day one 6/13/19

\\
Dear Anna,

\\
So to continue the story:

\\
I knew that I wanted to lead a Bible Study. I had such a good experience with Bible Studies in the past few years, and I didn't want that to end. My best friends all went to Bible Study with me. So I got with Michael Phillips and we discussed starting a Bible Study with Jazhiel and Becca. I got so excited. I started making a nice handout every week with questions on it. I formatted it to look good. I figured that a handout with the passage on it would be inviting to non-christians. We decided to go through Ephesians. I was especially excited to see the new freshman when they started to come to Georgia Tech.

\\
One of the things that Michael asked me to do was to help out at FASET by tabling. Tabling at FASET as a christian ministry is usually pretty challening I find. Most students will not stop by unless you have some food or if they are really interested. FASET is also conveniently during the summer when it is super hot outside at Georgia Tech. So typically we set up our tent and then bring popsicles or something else. Did I mention that it is hot?

\\
Well, God has an interesting way of making big things start small. I was tabling on June 13th last year. I was just doing my thing trying to convince freshmen that we were worth their time. This was one of the first times that I had tabled, so I was not very forward about getting in people's way and asking them if they'd like to hear more. It was either towards the beginning or the end of the tabling period, and we barely had anybody coming by. Lo and behold a freshman girl walks up to our table.

\\
I start rehearsing in my mind the things that we are going to say about RUF and how we will explain to her what we are. I don't remember how the conversation actually goes, but I remember that it was quite awkward because this girl already knew about RUF. It was also awkward because we were trying to figure out who she was. It took us several questions to figure out that she was related to Stephen Montgomery. It had been a while since I interacted with Stephen, so my memory of him was foggy. I can't remember anything else we talked about, but I guess we took a selfie.

\\
Can you believe that I meet you a year ago today:)

# The Prequel 6/12/19

\\
Dearest Anna,

\\
A little memory of the past... Dream with me...

\\
It was the summer of 2018. I had just finished working with NASA for a semester. I went home, then I went with Tiago to scuba dive in the Gulf. And to top it all off, I went to Georgia Tech to take summer classes after missing the first few days for diving. I did not know what to make of the semester. I planned on taking several challenging classes. I was talking health at the beginning of the semester, and I was talking CS 2110, Heat Transfer, and System Dyanmics for the whole semester. I had to figure out what I wanted to do in my free time.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href='https://photos.app.goo.gl/W39tcCaJiUaSG11H7'><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N0NC-aFWstASmKhrzZaLIJQ0y1C0znNNq6x_8OGVRd7Xh8ry3o-zYgqL8mkRJa3o1Pef_W4HffMU9Q0845F4B8fdWYNWmQDSPdpzTptUgu4QouDhpcuK3H3oQd8QEOR2Fg2qPvG0i3k=w2400' style="max-width: 49%; position: relative;"/></a>
</div>

<br>

I knew that I wanted to workout. I was going to cook my own food. I was going to be a Prototyping Instructor (PI). Finally, I was going to make things in my free time. I wanted to do a few more things, but these were the major things. I did not have very many friends, so I wanted to make some good friends. Additionally, I wanted to be part of a bible study or help lead one. 

\\
I was able to workout somewhat consistently. I did a lot of running and some lifting at the CRC. Matt Roelofs and I went running almost every week. He was training for an iron man. That was pretty fun. We'd go running early in the morning around the crc to beat the Georgia heat. I got pretty healthy with a good schedule.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<br>

Peter Achi was going to start his PhD in the fall at GT, and he started doing some research over the summer at GT. Instead of getting housing, he shared my room. He slept on my couch for a month. It was really fun to live with Peter. He cooks well. He is a lot of fun to be with. He is quirky. He enjoys good conversations. He works really hard too, so it made for a good study environment when we are both in the room.

<br>

<br>

I enjoyed cooking several dishes over the semester. I made pancakes, banana bread, a lot of salmon, breaded chicken, eggplant paramsan, and other stuff...

<br>

<br>

I made a few cutting boards in the Invention Studio.

</div>
<br>

I even made good friends. I became friends with Nathan and Matt. I meet a bunch of new people. I became better friends with Davis and Jake.

<br>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<br>

And I co-lead a bible study:) And so one of the biggest events in my life was one of the smallest things that happened to me over the summer.

<br>

# Ah I skipped a day! 6/11/19

\\
Dearest Anna,

\\
I missed a day! Sorry! I was really busy fixing some things that were semi urgent before we send our equipment down.

\\
Enjoy this really good food I had at a restaurent in Key West. Wish you could have been there to see the chickens and the southernmost point in the US.

# Key West 6/9/19

\\
Dearest Anna,

\\
Today we went to Key West. This city is pretty beautiful, but also very hot. My favorite thing about Key West is that there are chickens everywhere. They just walk around and do chicken things... It is crazy! I love it.

\\
I also went to the southernmost point of the US, so that was pretty cool.

\\
Really enjoyed talking to you today. I enjoyed our dreaming and our discussion of intimacy. Wish you could join me here in the Florida Keys.

\\
Miss you!

\\
Love,

Mateo


<br>

# Status update 6/8/19

\\
I made it safely to Florida. Thank God! Miss you Anna. I can't wait to catch up with you.

\\
Today I flew into Fort Lauderdale. I meetup with Kristina and Vickie and we drove to Key Lago. We are staying in a house by a canal. It is a nice house with iguanas and alligators and a very nice second floor. I look forward to working and relaxing here and enjoying the stay.

\\
I wish you could join me on this adventure Anna! It makes me miss you so much.

\\
Love,

Mateo


<br>

# You 6/7/19

\\
Dearest Anna,

\\
I thought I was not going to make this post tonight because I was tired. Now I know, I will not let a little bit of being tired stand between me doing something meaningful for you. I value you. I value you your love for Christ. I value his grace that he has bestowed upon you. I value the opportunity that we have to get to know each other.

\\
Enjoy this art I made and this picture of me driving a tractor when I was 12.

# Poetry (not my own) 6/6/19

\\
Dearest Anna,

\\
Here's some Shakespeare for you. Enjoy!

<br>

### “Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare (1564-1616)

<br>


Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:


Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm’d;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;

Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st;

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.


\\
Love,

Mateo
